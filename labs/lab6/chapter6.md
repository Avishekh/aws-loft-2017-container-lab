## Introduction

In this lab, we are going to build upon the previous labs and leverage what we have learned to utilize the OpenShift service broker. As part of this process, we will be using the latest code available for this project. To start out, you will provision a clean OpenShift environment that has the tech preview service broker interface.  By the time you are finished with the lab, you will have deployed an application, a database and binded the two together.  It should become evident how this self service process can improve the productivity of developers on your team.

Expected completion: 5-10 minutes

## Setup Environment
If you don't already have a docker hub account, you'll need one for this lab. Sign up here: 
[https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)

Cleanup the previous labs
```bash
$ ~/cleanup-oc.sh
```

Setup `pip` for `python`
```bash
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python -
```

Install virtualenv as this is tech preview and not available in the official repositories yet
```bash
$ cd ~/ && virtualenv --clear --system-site-packages ansible
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Install the latest version of Ansible
```bash
$ source ~/ansible/bin/activate
$ pip install -U docker ansible
```

Setup the Catalogue Service Broker
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tchughesiv/catasb
$ cd catasb/local/linux/
$ git checkout aws-loft
./run_setup_local.sh
```

Enter personal docker hub user/pass and use `ansibleplaybookbundle` for org.

A successful deployment will end with output similar to:
```bash

        "Visit https://<YOUR PUBLIC DNS HOSTNAME>:8443 for the web console",
        "OR",
        "For CLI access:",
        "oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify <YOUR PUBLIC DNS HOSTNAME>:8443 -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD>",
        ""
    ]
}

```

To interact w/ new cluster via command line -
```bash
$ source ~/ansible/bin/activate
$ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
$ oc version
oc v3.6.136
kubernetes v1.6.1+5115d708d7
features: Basic-Auth GSSAPI Kerberos SPNEGO

#$ oc login -u developer -p developer
#$ oc login -u admin -p admin
$ oc cluster status
Web console URL: https://ec2-xx.xx.xxx.xx.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8443
```

TODO: ask student to login as developer & go through guided tour on right menu first...

TODO: have them do hello-world apb deploy... view site landing page... then have them run postgres apb w/ bind to hello-world app.  redeploy hello-world & show same landing page w/ postgres connection showing.

TODO: explore on their own ... maybe logout and back in as admin?
